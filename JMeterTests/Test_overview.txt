Users count - 100
	- Generate 100 users with username : user1 password : password1
Rooms - Here we can have 3 stages
	1. Rooms have huge participants (total less rooms)
	2. Large no of rooms present (with less participants)
	3. Both
	
	Hence we will have a mix of both
	- 10 Rooms
		- Room1 - 5 members (user1 - user5)
		- Room2 - 90 members (user1 - user90)
		- Room3 - 50 members (user51-user100)
		- Room4 - 3 members (user98-100)
		- Room5 - 25 members (user61-85)
		- Room6 - 2 members (user90-91)
		- Room7 - 59 members (user30-87 + user5)
		- Room8 - 15 members (user66-79 + user5)
		- Room9 - 37 members (user21-56 + user5)
		- Room10 - 58 members (user11-67 + user5)

Chats - 
	- User steps into different rooms and starts chatting. Chatting can be split into 2 parts, which can be setup in parallel
		- Send messages
		- Listening for receiving messages
	Hence the flow
	- Spawn up 100 threads(users)
	- Open the socket connection
		- parallel_controller starts
			- loadmessages (few times maybe)
			- while_loop
				- sendmessage(wait for ACK)
				- some delay
			- while_loop
				- receive msg
